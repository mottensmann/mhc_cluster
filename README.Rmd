# `Clustering MHC class II alleles`

***

*This repository was forked from https://github.com/nextgenusfs/mhc_cluster.git` and adapted for processing Fur seal MHC II sequences*

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Fig_6_clustering.png", dpi = 300)
```

The script `cluster_mhc2.py` allows to cluster high-quality Illumina reads into putative alleles using the [Unoise3](http://drive5.com/usearch/manual/cmd_unoise3.html) approach [(Edgar 2016)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/15/081257).
Input sequences are `FASTQ` files generated on a Illumina MiSeq run. The following steps must be executed outside the clustering:

### Using cluster_mhc2.py

Input files are expected to be in `fastq` format containing the barcodes for individual samples within the header as shown below. Barcodes are required for demultiplexing reads prior to mapping reads to the generated list of alleles.

```
@MISEQ:279:000000000-AVVMJ:1:1101:14590:18831:N:0:barcodelabel=CAGAGAGGAAGGAGTA
```
For further information and a description of parameters see the helpfile:

```bash
cluster_mhc2.py -h
cluster_mhc3.py -h 
```

The subfolder `lib` contains required functions and may contain hidden Markov models created from multiple sequence alignment of previously characterised MHC genes using [HMMER3](http://hmmer.org/).   
Example using [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/) and [HMMER3](hmmer.org):

```bash
##	Align sequences
muscle -in input_sequences.fasta -out aligned_sequences.afa
#	Create hidden markov model	
hmmbuild hmm aligned_sequences.afa
#	Create auxiliary files
hmmpress hmm
```
